Language localisation, where the strings in interface and documentation are translated to a new language, is a rigorous and time consuming task. On the other hand machine translation systems, specifically Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems, are successfully used among many language pairs. However, still there are no SMT systems have been developed to translate any languages to Tamil or vice versa with reportable results. This research proposes a new methodology in which language localisation can be done using SMT.									</p>
									
								<p class="text-justify">
This research also identifies suitable parameters using which a SMT aided localisation system can be built. A pilot system is developed and the system is also outlined in this paper.  A RESTful API is also has been developed to facilitate localisation in remote tools. Already there are several open source software have been translated to Tamil and those translated English â€“ Tamil pairs were collected from various language resource files and then those are cleaned, tokenised and the system was trained using them. Another similar system is prepared with a data from generic domain apart from the collected technical data. Systems were trained with 2-gram, 3-gram and 4-gram language models that are created using two different language modelling tools namely KenLM and IRSTLM. Then the results were evaluated using BLEU algorithm. Appropriate parameters for setting up SMT system for localisation were identified from the evaluation. The results show that it would be enough to train a system with 3-gram, and the modified BLEU algorithm will give better understanding of the results compare to the original implementation of it. Further, among KenLM and IRSTM, KenLM performs better in terms of accuracy of results and the speed of execution.  									</p>

									Data are collected from language resource files of different open source projects as those have localised to Tamil. The parallel data, English phrases and corresponding Tamil phrases, collected from language resource files are used as training data and as testing data.  Amount of collected data are shown in Table 1. 
								</p>
								<p class="text-justify">
									In the succeeding sub phases, data are cleaned and prepared for training. Two system were built, and one was trained using all the data shown in Table 1, here after refereed as generic corpus, and other one was trained only with the technical data, which means without the EnTam v2.0; because, EnTam v2.0 is a general purpose corpus where most of the phrases are none technical phrases. The steps outlined here are followed for both systems.
